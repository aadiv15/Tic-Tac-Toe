# Tic-Tac-Toe
A cpp code for implementing a interactive game of Tic-Tac-Toe with multiple rounds (as many as the user wishes to play). The minimax algorithm has been used. The user can enter their moves in the form of row and column number in the grid. They cannot overwrite their or the computer's moves. Values are only allowed in the range 1-3 because the grid being considered in the game is also 3x3.

The code is designed for interactive console however line 155 in the main() can be uncommented if the user wishes to enter all the moves in one go. It is suitable for any device with a g++ or c++ compiler.

Any suggestions are welcome!
